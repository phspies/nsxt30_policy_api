# LbAppProfile

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Children** | [**[]ChildPolicyConfigResource**](ChildPolicyConfigResource.md) | subtree for this type within policy tree containing nested elements.  | [optional] [default to null]
**Overridden** | **bool** | Global intent objects cannot be modified by the user. However, certain global intent objects can be overridden locally by use of this property. In such cases, the overridden local values take precedence over the globally defined values for the properties.  | [optional] [default to false]
**MarkedForDelete** | **bool** | Intent objects are not directly deleted from the system when a delete is invoked on them. They are marked for deletion and only when all the realized entities for that intent object gets deleted, the intent object is deleted. Objects that are marked for deletion are not returned in GET call. One can use the search API to get these objects.  | [optional] [default to false]
**ResourceType** | **string** | An application profile can be bound to a virtual server to specify the application protocol characteristics. It is used to influence how load balancing is performed. Currently, three types of application profiles are supported: LBFastTCPProfile, LBFastUDPProfile and LBHttpProfile. LBFastTCPProfile or LBFastUDPProfile is typically used when the application is using a custom protocol or a standard protocol not supported by the load balancer. It is also used in cases where the user only wants L4 load balancing mainly because L4 load balancing has much higher performance and scalability, and/or supports connection mirroring. LBHttpProfile is used for both HTTP and HTTPS applications. Though application rules, if bound to the virtual server, can be used to accomplish the same goal, LBHttpProfile is intended to simplify enabling certain common use cases.  | [default to null]

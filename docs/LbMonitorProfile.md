## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Children** | [**[]ChildPolicyConfigResource**](ChildPolicyConfigResource.md) | subtree for this type within policy tree containing nested elements.  | [optional] [default to null]
**Overridden** | **bool** | Global intent objects cannot be modified by the user. However, certain global intent objects can be overridden locally by use of this property. In such cases, the overridden local values take precedence over the globally defined values for the properties.  | [optional] [default to false]
**MarkedForDelete** | **bool** | Intent objects are not directly deleted from the system when a delete is invoked on them. They are marked for deletion and only when all the realized entities for that intent object gets deleted, the intent object is deleted. Objects that are marked for deletion are not returned in GET call. One can use the search API to get these objects.  | [optional] [default to false]
**ResourceType** | **string** | There are two types of healthchecks: active and passive. Passive healthchecks depend on failures in actual client traffic (e.g. RST from server in response to a client connection) to detect that the server or the application is down. In case of active healthchecks, load balancer itself initiates new connections (or sends ICMP ping) to the servers periodically to check their health, completely independent of any data traffic. Currently, active health monitors are supported for HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, UDP and ICMP protocols.  | [default to null]
